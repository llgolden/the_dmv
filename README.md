# The DMV

## Learning Goals

- Utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Host code on Github and use Pull Requests
- Create an Object-Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
- Work with an existing codebase
- Manipulate data from external sources

## Overview

When we get hired for a new job, the vast majority of us will be working with existing code for a project already in production (which means it’s live on the internet for people to use). It will probably have some bugs that need to be fixed, inefficiencies in the code, as well as new features to be built. One of the purposes of this project is to practice the skill of onboarding to an existing project. You’ll also practice using Ruby to build out some new functionality for The Department of Motor Vehicles.

## Reflection Questions:

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? I took the errors/failures one at a time. I opened one class, ran the file, xit-ed any errors after the first. I also noticed that some of the classes refence other classes so I made sure to complete the debugging for any classes that were referenced first before completing debugging for classes that refer to that class.  

2. What was hard about working with code you did not write? Figuring out where to start, how the files relate to each other, fixing bugs, seeing code and tests written differently than how I would have written them (and not the convention I am used to seeing), etc.

3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? Reading over the instructions and completing a Problem Solving strategy on my own before starting made this easier for me. I knew what my goal was and did not get distracted by everything going on in the files
